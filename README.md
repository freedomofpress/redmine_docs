# SecureDrop Redmine Support Documentation (Archived)

This repository was originally used to hold the documentation for SecureDrop's [Redmine-based support system](https://support.freedom.press). The support system is also available as a Tor Onion Service (http://sup6h5iyiyenvjkfxbgrjynm5wsgijjoatvnvdgyyi7je3xqm4kh6uqd.onion/).

Because of the maintenance burden and the minimal amount of content, the
decision was made to integrate it with the SecureDrop project documentation
itself.

You can now [find the documentation here.](https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/getting_support.html)

And contribute to the documentation [at this repository.](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-docs)
